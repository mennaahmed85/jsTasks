/*
1. Create an object named `calculator` that has two properties: `num1` and `num2`, both numbers.
2. Add a method `sum` to the object, which returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
3. Add another method `describeSum` that prints "The sum of [num1] and [num2] is [sum]" using `this` and the `sum` method.
